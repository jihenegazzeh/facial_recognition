The objective of our facial recognition initiative is to be integrated into an employee check-in system to boost security measures and streamline the check-in procedure. By utilizing facial recognition technology, employees can effortlessly scan their faces at designated checkpoints to obtain access or authorization to specific areas within the premises. 

This solution offers a secure, convenient, and efficient alternative for employees, thereby enhancing operational efficiency within the workplace. It eliminates the requirement for physical keys, thereby reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access. 

The process initiates with the loading and encoding of employee images from a specified file. If an employee's image is not present, there is a provision to add it, or if necessary, remove it in case the employee has exited the organization.

The system is engineered to detect the face, ascertain its location, and assign the corresponding name of the individual. This procedure is supplemented by the computation of a confidence level and a blur score.

Upon successful identification of the individual, a green LED light is triggered, displaying the message "Access Granted". Conversely, if the identification process fails, a red LED light is activated, displaying the message "Access Denied". This approach ensures a superior level of security and efficiency in access control.
